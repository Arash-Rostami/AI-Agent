The underlying architecture relies on Laravel 10, Filament PHP 3, and MySQL.
The Commercial Lifecycle
1. Contract Creation: A Proforma Invoice (PI) is created first. This represents the main contract.
2. Advance Payment: An advance Payment Request is created, linked to the Proforma Invoice. A Payment is then recorded against this request.
3. Execution (Orders): Based on the contract, one or many Orders are created. Each order represents a shipment or part.
4. Logistics: Each Order connects to specific Order Details (financials), Logistics (shipping), and Docs (customs/BL).
5. Balance Payments: As orders proceed, Payment Requests for balances are created. These are linked to the Order (not the PI).
6. Finalization: When order_status is closed or accounting_approved, the order is successfully sent and financially verified.
Currency & Entity Logic
•	Foreign Currency: Usually associated with Suppliers and main contracts (Proforma/Orders).
•	Rial Currency: Usually associated with Contractors, domestic payments, and Packaging costs.
•	These are all currency values in BMS: 'USD', 'EURO', 'Yuan', 'Dirham', 'Ruble', 'Rial'.

•	Proforma Invoice: proforma_number (starts with PI-) or contract_number.
•	Order: reference_number (starts with O-), invoice_number, or part.
•	Payment Request: reference_number (starts with PR-).
•	Payment: reference_number (starts with P-).
The extra column in many tables is a JSON field containing miscellaneous details.
