# AI Agent Service Overview

## 📖 Introduction

This AI Agent Service is a specialized, intelligent assistant designed to provide accurate, context-aware support for users. It acts as a central brain that can be integrated into various platforms (like web chats or internal portals) to answer questions, perform tasks, and retrieve real-time information.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Conversation
*   **Natural Language Understanding:** Capable of understanding and responding to complex queries in both **Farsi** and **English**.
*   **Context Retention:** Remembers previous parts of the conversation to maintain a natural, flowing dialogue without asking for repetition.
*   **Multi-Model Intelligence:** Powered by advanced AI models (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) to ensure high-quality, human-like interactions.

### 2. Real-Time Web Search
*   **Live Information:** Unlike standard static AIs, this agent can browse the web to find the absolute latest news, facts, and data.
*   **Citations:** When answering with web data, it provides sources, ensuring transparency and trust.
*   **Selective Activation:** Users can toggle this feature on or off depending on their needs.

### 3. Integrated Tools

*   **Business Knowledge:** Has direct access to specific business documents (Persol services and policies) to answer company-related questions accurately.

### 4. Secure & Embedded Mode
*   **Restricted Mode:** When embedded in third-party sites (via iframe), the agent automatically activates a secure mode.
*   **Safety First:** In this mode, sensitive tools are disabled by default to prevent misuse, while still allowing helpful interactions. Web search can be securely enabled if needed.

## 🎯 Use Cases
