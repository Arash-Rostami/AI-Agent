# ü§ñ Gemini AI Agent ‚Äî Your Smart Assistant Starter Kit

A minimal, full-stack Node.js agent powered by Google's Gemini API. It includes chat history, dynamic routing, robust error handling, and practical tool integration patterns. This project is built for developers who want to go beyond "Hello, world" and dive into real AI workflows.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Configuration

To get this AI Agent up and running on your local machine, you'll need to set up a few environment variables for API keys and core configuration.

### 1\. Environment Variables (`.env` file)

This project relies on environment variables to manage sensitive API keys and other settings. You'll need to create a new file named `.env` in the **root** of your project (the same directory where `package.json` and `app.js` are located).

Populate your `.env` file with the following:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
GEMINI_API_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent
WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE
PORT=3000
```

üö® **Important:** Remember to replace the placeholder values (`YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE`, `YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY_HERE`) with your actual API keys.

-----

#### üîë How to Get Your API Keys:

  * **`GOOGLE_API_KEY` (for Gemini API):**

    1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://ai.google.dev/studio).
    2.  Sign in with your Google Account.
    3.  In the left sidebar, click **"Get API key"** or **"Get API key in Google AI Studio."**
    4.  Click **"Create API key"** (or "Create API key in new project").
    5.  Copy the generated key and paste it into your `.env` file.

    <!-- end list -->

      * *Security Note:* This key is essential for authenticating with the Gemini API. Keep it secure and **never** commit your `.env` file to public repositories.

  * **`WEATHER_API_KEY` (for Weather Tool):**

    1.  You'll need an API key from a weather service. A widely used and free option is [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).
    2.  Visit [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
    3.  Once registered, your API key (often labeled `APPID`) will be sent to your confirmation email or can be found on your [API keys page](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) within your account dashboard.
    4.  Copy this key and paste it into your `.env` file.

  * **`GEMINI_API_URL`:**

      * This specifies the default API endpoint for the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. You typically won't need to modify this unless you intend to use a different Gemini model or a specific deployment.

  * **`PORT`:**

      * This defines the port number on which your local server will run (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Feel free to change this if port `3000` is already in use on your system.

-----

### 2\. Installation

Once your `.env` file is all set up, you can install the necessary project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or, if you use Yarn:
yarn install
```

-----

### 3\. Running the Project

This project utilizes `nodemon` for a smoother development experience, as it automatically restarts the server whenever you save code changes.

  * **First, make sure you have `nodemon` installed globally** on your system (if you don't already):

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    # or, if you use Yarn:
    yarn global add nodemon
    ```

    *(Alternatively, if you prefer not to install globally, you can install it as a development dependency: `npm install --save-dev nodemon` or `yarn add nodemon -D`, and then run it via `npx nodemon app.js`)*

  * **Then, to start the AI Agent:**

    ```bash
    nodemon app.js
    ```

üöÄ The server should now be running successfully\! Your AI Agent is ready to process requests, and any code changes you make will automatically restart the server.

## Good luck, and happy coding\! üòâ
